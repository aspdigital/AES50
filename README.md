# AES50 VHDL IP
An implementation of the AES50 protocol in vanilla VHDL.

## About the IP
I started developing this IP around end of 2024 - originally with some other intention.   
However I decided to make this project public with the purpose to be used in the fabulous [OpenX32 project](https://github.com/OpenMixerProject/OpenX32).  
Therefore, this IP was developed fully independent/separated from the OpenX32 project and comes instead with a reference implementation on a custom PCB (also included in this repo) designed around an [Efinix Trion T20 FPGA](https://www.efinixinc.com/shop/t20.php).  
Integration into the OpenX32 project is still a to-do work.. But I'm sure those guys will manage :)

### Aux Data Tunnel
AES50 provides (as part of the protocol) an auxiliary data channel with a fixed bandwidth of roughly 5 Mbit/s (the exact rate depends on the selected sample rate, as the auxiliary data stream is synchronous with the audio transmission).  
According to the AES50 specification, there was a proposal (though not mandatory) to use standard Ethernet frames that could be tunneled through this auxiliary data channel - (ever wondered about the mysterious Ethernet port on the DN9630?) -> Therefore I assume that this proposed approach using virtual Ethernet frames is also used in other AES50 devices on the market.  
However, additional mechanisms are required to transmit Ethernet frames through the auxiliary channel - specifically bit-stuffing and data-scrambling. 

#### Aux Data over TDM  
Since the bitstream is synchronous with the audio transmission, this IP enables sending and receiving the aux-bitstream over the TDM8 interface.  
Internally, the IP handles the bitstream as 16-bit words, and the TDM module distributes the auxiliary data evenly across the eight TDM slots as 24-bit “samples.”  
The extra 8 bits act as an overlay protocol to ensure correct interpretation of the auxiliary words when tunneling them over a 3rd party audio-transportation-medium.  
If the TDM-Aux-RX/TX pins of two instances of this IP are cross-connected, it allows transparent tunneling of the auxiliary data channel as long as synchronicity and bit-consistency is ensured.  
A similar concept appears to be implemented in the Appsys Multiverter, which tunnels AES50 auxiliary data as eight audio channels through a Dante network to maintain head-amp remote control.

- See further details in the TDM module implementation

#### Aux Data over UART
It is also possible to send and receive data over the aux-data-tunnel with a UART connection.    
The actual protocol which is e.g. used for headamp control is still under investigation as the AES50 specification itself is only defining how the data-tunnel works.     
See here an example print-out of a Wing-Rack connected.    
![Example UART Printout](Doc/realterm_uart_aux_rx.png?raw=true "Aux Uart Printout")

#### Head Amp Remote Control Example
A small [Arduino example](RPI_Pico_2040_HA_Remote_Example/RPI_Pico_2040_HA_Remote_Example.ino) shows how to self-identify and remotely control the head amps (gain & phantom power) of AES50 devices.

This example uses a Raspberry Pi Pico (RP2040), which acts as a command bridge between a computer and the UART terminal connected to the FPGA/AES50 IP core.  
The device identifies itself as an X32 Full-Size and the head amps can be controlled via a serial terminal using the following command examples:

- `gain:ch1@20` → Sets gain on channel 1 to +20 dB  
- `phantom:ch5@1` → Enables +48V on channel 5  
- `phantom:ch5@0` → Disables +48V on channel 5  

The gain-ranges may be interpreted differently with different devices. You will find some info in the comments of the code-example.  
This example is currently configured for controlling a Wing. Make sure that Remote-HA-Control over AES50 is enabled in the console settings.  

Special thanks to Christian Nöding for reverse-engineering the proprietary protocol and Thomas Zint (Behringer R&D) for helping with the checksum calculation.  

Note: The transmission of channel-names does not work yet.

### Audio Interface Timing

Warning: When this IP is in I2S/TDM slave-mode (sys_mode_i = "10"), make ultimately sure, that BCLK/WCLK is stable before releasing the IP's reset.  
AES50 protocol has a pulse-width modulation mechanism in the outgoing (LVDS-)clock signals which needs to be synchronized to the incoming I2S/TDM clock.  
This is only done once after reset. You must ensure externally, if WCLK/BCLK has changed or was unstable, this IP core runs again through a new reset.

#### I2S
In I2S mode, BCLK is 64*fs : 32-Bit per Slot (24-Bit Audio + 8 Bit Padding).  
3.072 MHz for 48k mode and 2.8224 MHz for 44k1. No other I2S configuration is supported besides this.  
This is valid for all system-modes.

#### TDM-8
BCLK is supposed to be 12.288 MHz for 48k or 11.2896 MHz for 44k1 : 32-Bit per Slot (24-Bit Audio + 8 Bit Padding).  
No other TDM configuration is supported besides this.  
This is valid for all system-modes.

#### TDM-8 Master Timing (when BCLK/WCLK is output)
When the IP is TDM master, the WCLK will be high for 8 BCLK cycles. 
![TDM8 Master Timing](Doc/tdm8_8cycles_fsync_pulse.png?raw=true "TDM8 Master Timing")

#### TDM-8 Slave Timing (when BCLK/WCLK is input)
WCLK must be only high for one BCLK pulse (but can be longer of course)
![TDM8 Slave Timing](Doc/tdm8_flexible_fsync_pulse.png?raw=true "TDM8 SlaveTiming")



### Misc
#### Deviations against the specification
- Bit-Error correction is only implemented on the transmitting side (as AES50 devices on market expects this to be implemented properly), however this IP does not correct bit-errors on receiving side. (I personally don't see this as a critical feature. Basically no other network audio protocol has this implemented)
- AES50 specifies a delay of around 3 sample times IP in- to output (in 44k1, 48k). However this IP processes the audio-samples internally in frames of 6 samples at 48k or 11 samples at 44k1. Therefore the latency is slightly higher
- Clock integrity check: AES50 by default runs the LVDS-clock-signals (through the CAT-wire) bidirectional. Even though it would be technically enough to run the clock only unidrectional from the clock-master to the clock-slave, AES50 uses this to check the integrity of the clock-recovery (PLL) on the AES50-slave-device side. As I understood, the slave-device would be supposed to regenerate the pulse-width modulated clock signal based on the recovered clock and send it back to the master. However this IP just loops the clock back to the master in case it is in slave-configuration. Also as per spec, the AES50 should verify the clock speeds for correctness. This IP has implemented only a more simple timeout-watchdog alike clock integrity checking (on both clock-transmitting and clock-receiving side).
- AES50 also supports other audio-formats and sample-rates (e.g. Bitstream-Audio, 88k2, 96k, etc..). This IP is only usable for 24-Bit PCM-Audio for 44k1 and 48k. However the IP is prepared for later integration of 88k2 and 96k sample-rate. I just didn't do this because I was lacking of suitable devices which support AES50 with 88k2/96k.
- The original AES50 implementation found in commercial devices also seem to differ against the specification (or I understood the specification wrong) in two points I found out so far (by actually reverse engineering it):
  -  The figures for aux-data-packet scrambler / descrambler in the specification seem to be exchanged against each other. The actual data-scrambler is the logic-structure shown in the descrambler-figure and vice-versa
  -  In 48k mode, one LC-segment (352 Bits) should consist of in sum 12 LC-sub-segments with two multiplexed channels of 6 samples each having 2-bit padding after each LC-subsegment and 4-bit padding at the end of the LC-frame.  According to my calculations, one LC-subsegment should be 27-bits long (12* (27Bit LC-Subsegment + 2-Bit Padding))+4-Bit Padding = 352 Bit. However the actual protocol behaves like: (6* (26-Bit LC-Subsegment + 2-Bit Padding + 28-Bit LC-Subsegment + 2-Bit Padding)) + 4-Bit Padding = 352 Bit.

#### TODOs / next steps / not done yet
- Verification of internal clock domain crossings
- Constraining and verification of input- & output timings (RMII, TDM, etc..)
- Bit Transparency Testing
- Refactoring of TDM SerDes
- Implement 88k2/96k mode
- Check why the Arduino Code-Example is not transmitting channel-names correctly.
  
#### Random Info
- The core-clock of this IP can also run at a reduced clock-speed of 80 MHz (instead of 100 MHz) if I2S mode only is used. Some internal timing-reference values must be changed for this (see in the top VHDL module in the efinity project)
- In case, the IP will be used in sys_mode_i="01" (AES-master + TDM/I2S master) only, the external PLL is not necessarily needed and the IP can be tricked to run from a static oscilator with 1024xfs speed.   Connect the static 1024xfs clock to "clk_1024xfs_from_pll_i", make "pll_init_busy_i" and "pll_lock_n_i" to static '0' and just leave "clk_to_pll_o" and "pll_mult_value_o" open.
- sys_mode_i, fs_mode_i and tdm8_i2s_mode_i should not be changed on the fly. If this is changed, the IP needs a new reset.
- Spot the easter-egg in this project :-)

### FPGA Resource Utilization
This is the resource utilization for a full configuration (all sample-rates and operation modes supported, dual TDM/I2S support, PLL-I2C driver etc.).  
Resource utilization depends on actual used configuration.  
Especially if core is configured for e.g. I2S only operation, the utilization is reduced drastically (the TDM-Serdes is still a rather resource-inefficient implementation as of today).
